### Direct Digital Synthesis Radio-Frequency Module
This is a part of the implementation for the Ultracold Control System provided by ParkerLab at Georgia Tech.
A DDS module can generate a sequence of radio-frequency over 4 channels. The RF signals are generated by the AD9959 chip controlled by the MCU, supporting frequency within 0-200MHz. The module supports amplitude and frequency linear ramp, as well as dithering.
### Hardware
The corresponding hardware design can be find in https://github.com/parkerlab-external/UltracoldPCB-DDS.
### Protocol
To update the sequence the module accepts command lists in the following format.
```
 × m    #bytes      1         1            2
        value       'E'       slot id      chkpt count 
 × n    #bytes      1         1            1           2            4               4
        value       'U'       slot id      mask        chkpt pos    duration        value 
 × 1    #bytes      1
        value       'T'
```
The four slots in the MCU do not correspond to the four output channels.
The first 4 bits of `mask` specify the command's target channels, while the later 4 bits specify the data type of the `value` in the same command: amplitude/frequency/dithering amplitude.
The `duration` and `value` are polymorphic: a negative `duration` represents a jump to the corresponding absolute `value`, while a positive duration means that the `value` is an increment that's executed per cycle, for a total of `duration` cycles.
An implementation of the backend can be found here: https://github.com/parkerlab-external/UltracoldSequenceRunner.
### Configurables
The device specific configuration of the UART address can be set in `config_device.h`.
